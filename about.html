            Hi, my name is Daniel.
          </h1>

        <div class="p-about">
          <p>My journey into computers began at a young age, like any young boy growing up in the 2000's, the thought of building technology never popped into my head until High School came around. When the thought 
            crossed my mind, two thing stopped me from giving it a go. One, was because I thought I'd find purpose in making movies but the main reason at a time when I wasn't so sure of what I was capable of, I 
            believed you had to be a certain type of person to be able to code. I believed it was above me.
          </p>
          <p>One day, what seemed to be the perfect timing, a programming friend of mine suggested I should get into software and I had a million typical questions for him, such as "don't you have to be good at maths",
            "don't you have to be good at this/that". He's responses was enough to give me the confidence that I'd be good at this if I was willing to put in the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the next couple weeks I played around with web programming on freecodecamp and eventually found myself inrolled in Harvard University Introduction to Computer Science and the Art of Programming. After that
            I never looked back and have now finished the course and am currently enrolled and working through Introduction to Programming with Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of the reason I was driven to studying online and not at a University was because I had always felt through those type of courses having a deadline would never have allowed me to build self disipline
            with my work to get it done on my own. Currently Harvards Computer Science course is the proudest I have been of all the education I have accomplished because it was something that meant something to me and it
            is a skill I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
